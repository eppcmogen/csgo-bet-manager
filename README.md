# CSGO Bet Manager
 I originally made this for a friend who needed a solution to track all his bets from start to finish.
 
 CSGO: Counter-Strike Global Offensive
 
 Essentially each unique IP is able to create a single bet session, in which you start with some amount ($$). Then you add games to bet on, i.e. VP vs. Fnatic. If they win, you simply modify the bet to "Win", and the session updates with the new value proposition.
 
 For example,
 1. Create a new betting session: "EZ WIN BOYS"
 2. You start with $10.
 3. A game is added, (GODLIKE vs. CLOUD9). Settings - (Odds: 1.2 with CLOUD9) (Bet amount: $5), save
 4. Watch the game, CLOUD9 Wins
 5. Click the "checkmark" on that bet.
 6. Graphs and the new data amount is updated in the thread session.
